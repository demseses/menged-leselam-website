      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p><strong>Menged Leselam</strong> was founded by <strong>Tsion Kefene Gerbaba</strong>, an international student and advocate for justice, and <strong>Yeabsira Kefene Gerbaba</strong>, a developer and digital strategist. The duo envisioned a platform that amplifies the voices of the displaced and translates empathy into action.</p>
      <p>Inspired by lived experiences and grounded in Ethiopian values, the project is a fusion of technology, community design, and faith inclusion.</p>

      <h2>Our Work</h2>
      <p>
        Menged Leselam operates across five strategic pillars:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Livelihoods:</strong> Skills training, small business support, and local hiring practices to empower IDPs economically.</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Enrolling children in schools, setting up mobile learning stations, and girls’ clubs to support vulnerable populations.</li>
          <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Partnering with clinics and NGOs to ensure access to basic health services.</li>
          <li><strong>Peacebuilding & Social Cohesion:</strong> Community workshops and dialogue forums to promote inclusion and understanding between IDPs and hosts.</li>
          <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Deploying the Tesfa Link app to connect displaced persons to services, job opportunities, and community events.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

    <section id="challenge" class="fade-in">
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Ethiopia is home to one of the world’s largest IDP populations. These individuals and families often suffer in silence, lacking legal documentation, access to resources, or safe housing. Humanitarian efforts, though valuable, often stop short of long-term integration.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>59% of IDPs are children</li>
        <li>Women face increased risk of gender-based violence</li>
        <li>Top regions: Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, Benishangul-Gumuz</li>
        <li>45% live in host communities, creating social strain</li>
        <li>Peacebuilding and development are inseparable prerequisites (DSWG, Ethiopia)</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="case-studies" class="fade-in">
      <h2>Case Studies</h2>
      <div class="case">
        <h3>NaTakallam – Lebanon</h3>
        <p>This platform pays displaced persons to teach their native languages online. It promotes cultural exchange while restoring economic agency. We’re inspired by its scalable, tech-powered approach to dignity through service.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="case">
        <h3>Kuja Kuja – Uganda & Rwanda</h3>
        <p>A real-time feedback platform that allows displaced people to rate aid services. 90% of users felt more respected. We adapted this idea to embed feedback loops in our Tesfa Link app, emphasizing agency and accountability.</p>
